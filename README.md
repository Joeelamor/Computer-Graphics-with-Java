Game of Tetris
==============

This repository includes development of tetris game with Java, every latter update is based on all previous works.

### Current

Write a program to draw the interface of the Game of Tetris. The game involves playing with different shapes, each composed of 4 squares. The main area (large rectangle) should be sized as 10 x 20 squares (i.e. 10 square wide and 20 squares high). The small rectangle on the right shows that will soon appear in the main area (a red “L” shape).
 
### The tasks include:

-   If the mouse cursor moves inside the main area, `PAUSE` (in a large font) will be displayed; and if the cursor moves out of the area, `PAUSE` will disappear.
-   Change of the window dimension will only possibly change the size, but not the relative position and aspect ratio of any component.
-   If the button `QUIT` is pressed, the program terminates and quits (this should not be the quit from the window's standard pull-down menu).
-   Randomly select one of the 7 shapes to be displayed in the center at the top of `Main area` and randomly select a different shape to be displayed in `Next shape`. The starting orientation of the shape can be fixed.

-	 The shape at the top of `Main area` moves down (falls) at a constant speed. Once the shape's lowest edge touches the bottom of `Main area` or the top edge of another shape, it stops moving and stays there.

-	 When the cursor is outside of `Main area`, each click on the left mouse button moves the falling shape to the left by one square, and similarly, the right button moves the shape to the right by one square. A forward scroll of the mouse wheel will rotate the shape clockwise and a backward scroll will rotate the shape counter-clockwise. If the mouse cursor moves inside `Main area`, the falling stops, i.e. a pause.
