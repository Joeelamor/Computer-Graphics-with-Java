# Game of Tetris
 This repository includes development of tetris game with Java, every latter update is based on all previous works.
## To run the code
To run the code, first you need to remove the first line(package name) of all code files or just change the package name as you want. Then you can run the main file and you will see the result.

## Current
 Write a program to draw the interface of the Game of Tetris. The game involves playing with different shapes, each composed of 4 squares. The main area (large rectangle) should be sized as 10 x 20 squares (i.e. 10 square wide and 20 squares high). The small rectangle on the right shows that will soon appear in the main area (a red “L” shape).
 
### The tasks include:
- If the mouse cursor moves inside the main area, “PAUSE” (in a large font) will be displayed; and if the cursor moves out of the area, “PAUSE” will disappear.
- Change of the window dimension will only possibly change the size, but not the relative position and aspect ratio of any component.
- If the button “QUIT” is pressed, the program terminates and quits (this should not be the quit from the window’s standard pull-down menu).
