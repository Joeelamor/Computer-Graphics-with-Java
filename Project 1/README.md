# Game of Tetris with Java
 This repository includes several computer graphics projects with Java, every latter project is based on all previous projects.
 
## Project 1
 Write a program to draw the interface of the Game of Tetris. The game involves playing with different shapes, each composed of 4 squares. The main area (large rectangle) should be sized as 10 x 20 squares (i.e. 10 square wide and 20 squares high). The small rectangle on the right shows that will soon appear in the main area (a red “L” shape).
