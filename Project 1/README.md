# Project 1
To run the code, first you need to remove the first line of all code files or just change the package name. Then you can run then main file and you will see the result.

## The tasks include:
- If the mouse cursor moves inside the main area, “PAUSE” (in a large font) will be displayed; and if the cursor moves out of the area, “PAUSE” will disappear.
- Change of the window dimension will only possibly change the size, but not the relative position and aspect ratio of any component.
- If the button “QUIT” is pressed, the program terminates and quits (this should not be the quit from the window’s standard pull-down menu).
